I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Economics at Central Washington University (CWU) in Ellensburg, Washington.  

My research examines how institutional structures, policy interventions, and geopolitical risks shape macroeconomic dynamics and financial markets. I study topics at the intersection of macroeconomics, international finance, and corporate behavior - including rare earth supply chain vulnerability, financial market integration, ESG regulation, corporate misconduct, strategic communication, and the monetary implications of digital currency.

Across these projects, my work explores how firms, workers, and policymakers respond to uncertainty and regulatory change, and how these responses affect business cycles, financial stability, and market efficiency.

I received my Ph.D. from the University of Washington (Seattle), M.A. degrees from the University of Washington and Seoul National University, and a B.A. from Yonsei University, all in Economics.
