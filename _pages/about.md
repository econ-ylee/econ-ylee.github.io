Welcome to my personal webpage! My name is Yurim Lee and I am currently an assistant professor in the Department of Economics at Central Washington University (CWU). 

My research interests are macroeconomics, international economics, labor market, structural reforms and entrepreneurship. Specifically, I study why workers have an incentive to become small mom-and-pop business owners and how this occupational choice can have an effect on business cycle dynamics, macroeconomic inefficiency, and policy reforms. 

I received my Ph.D. at University of Washington - Seattle (UW), M.A.s from UW and Seoul National University (Seoul, Korea), and B.A. from Yonsei University (Seoul, Korea), majoring in Economics for all of them.  

I am originally from Korea and speak fluent English and Korean.
