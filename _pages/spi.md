title: Central Washington University (CWU) Student Price Index (SPI)
---

## Overview

Since January 2021, the Economics Association and the Department of Economics at CWU are jointly leading a project that aims to develop a price index to determine the cost of college living in Ellensburg, Washington. Every month, based on a campus-wide survey, the Economic Association members gather prices of goods commonly consumed by CWU students from different stores in Ellensburg to compute the SPI and inflation rates. This index serves to identify the price changes that students in Ellensburg encounter, making it a valuable tool.
