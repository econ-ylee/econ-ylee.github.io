title: Central Washington University (CWU) Student Price Index (SPI)
---

## Overview

Since January 2021, the Economics Association and the Department of Economics at CWU are jointly leading a project that aims to develop a price index to determine the cost of college living in Ellensburg, Washington. Every month, based on a campus-wide survey, the Economic Association members gather prices of goods commonly consumed by CWU students from different stores in Ellensburg to compute the SPI and inflation rates. This index serves to identify the price changes that students in Ellensburg encounter, making it a valuable tool.

## Student testimonials on the project

* ``The Student Price Index has allowed me the opportunity to have hands on experience working with large data sets in a non-controlled environment like the classroom. This project has reinforced and built upon critical skills developed in the Economic Department courses.'' - S. Apostolides
* ``The SPI project has helped develop my ability to think critically and collaborate effectively with my peers. Through this, I have been able to apply theoretical concepts I have learned to real-world applications and better my understanding of economic research.'' - C. McNair
* ``As an economics student, the SPI gave me the chance to engage in academic research from an early stage. Starting as a presenter and price collector, my involvement boosted my confidence as a researcher and allowed me to see real-world applications of economics. This experience sparked a passion for research, leading me to pursue a master's degree, a future Ph.D., and a career in academia. As the youngest in my master's cohort, the SPI project has helped me thrive in academic discussions and provided a sense of belonging and accomplishment that continues to shape my work.'' - L. Hashimura
