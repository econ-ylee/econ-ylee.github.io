**Abstract**: This paper studies how pecuniary self-employment affects business cycle dynamics, macroeconomic efficiency, and the outcomes of structural reforms. I employ a two-sector dynamic general equilibrium model with endogenous producer entry. One sector (the "hiring sector") is populated by monopolistically competitive firms that employ workers subject to search-and-matching frictions in order to produce output. The other sector consists of self-employment firms that use the output of the first sector as input. Self-employment is introduced as a possible occupational choice for the unemployed, relating firm creation more directly to the state of the labor market and to workers' opportunity costs. Consistent with the U.S. data, the model shows that self-employment represents 7.4% of employment and is procyclical. The procyclicality of self-employment arises as positive productivity shocks in the hiring sector cause profits for the self-employed to rise strongly enough that additional unemployed workers are drawn into self-employment, despite tighter labor market conditions and a competing incentive to seek traditional employment. As a result, the number of firms is more volatile and welfare costs of business cycles are higher in the presence of self-employment. Novel sources of inefficiency exist since neither workers nor firms internalize the consequences of self-employment. This dispels the common misconception that all labor market rigidities increase self-employment; on the contrary, economies with almost no unemployment benefits or a very weak bargaining power could still show high self-employment rates. Furthermore, I show that reforms facilitating entry in one or the other sector are more effective when the self-employed are relatively less productive or have greater monopoly power.

* Trade Liberalization and Structural Reforms under Self-Employment

**Abstract**: Self-employment is much more prominent in small open economies and extremely concentrated in nontraded service sector goods that do not require very high skills and have low barrier to entry. I construct a two-sector dynamic, general equilibrium model in a small open economy framework where the self-employed produce nontradable goods. Through this setup, I ask the consequences of trade liberalization and its effect on the wage inequality under the presence of self-employment.

* Reducing the United States’ Risks of Dependency on China in the Rare Earth Market, with Tennecia Dacass (CWU)

**Abstract**: Rare earth elements (REE) are crucial in supporting multiple industries with new technologies. Thus the U.S.' demand for REE is still on the rise. Yet, most of the supply comes from China, which exposes the U.S. to supply risks similar to that observed by the export quota imposed by China in 2010-2011. This paper uses supply and demand models to evaluate and compare the effects to which the proposed strategies by the U.S. have on reducing supply risks associated with potential export restrictions from China. We show that there are multiple possible policies available to mitigate the impact of China’s dominance in the market by attenuating the price increases and supply shortfalls, with the size of the changes depending on the price elasticity of demand and supply for REE. In addition, there are varying degrees of welfare gains from each proposal. Specifically, reducing domestic demand for REE by recycling and finding alternatives provides the largest welfare gains. The next best welfare-improving proposal is discovering new domestic supplies of REE, followed by plans to gain access to foreign REE sources.

* Growth, Unemployment, and the Public Sector, with Alejandro González (WUSTL)

**Abstact**: The public sector wage bill represents an important component of total employment and fiscal expenditures. For the U.S. economy, it accounts for 60% of government expenditures. Despite these facts, our understanding of how public sector employment and wages affect long-run macroeconomic performance remains surprisingly limited. This paper attempts to contribute to filling this gap by setting out a rich but tractable model of endogenous growth with search and matching frictions where the private sector produces output using private sector labor, capital and public infrastructure. This simple structure allows us to analyze how public sector wages and vacancies affect unemployment and growth. Our setup highlights how the decision to invest in public infrastructure to enhance growth might have unintended consequences on the unemployment rate, which is a novel mechanism in the literature. Furthermore, we investigate if appropriate public sector wages and vacancies can internalize the externality from public infrastructure in the presence of production externalities.

* Reflections on the Volcker Rule: Innovations in the Financial Services Industry and Fixing Too Big to Succeed, with Koushik Ghosh (CWU)

**Abstract**: Ever since the financial crisis of 2007-08, the policy community has woken up to the pressing need for reform of the banking and financial sector. An important goal is to institute structural changes that would maintain robust financial markets, the use of innovative financial products, while preventing the corrosive social and political crises that have bedeviled the world since 2007-08. This paper analyses and critiques how recent rule changes in proprietary trading (Volcker Rule), emergent knowledge about banking structure and the scope of activities of banks, may be employed to reduce systemic risk in the future, and thus avoid costly financial collapses, and damaging political-economic fallout.
